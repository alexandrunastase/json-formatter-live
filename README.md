## A note on the new domain name

The `jsonformatter.com` domain doesn't belong to the owner of the repo, but was kindly pointed to the app by its owner under the following conditions:

 - Keep the code open source
 - Keep the app advertising free
 - Make sure the app is relatively maintained (TLS certificates are up-to-date, app is functional and has a decent uptime )
 
`jsonformatter.live` will continue to exist and will redirect to the new domain
 
Pro tip: If you installed the app on your computer using the `.live` domain, you will need to reinstall using the new one to get rid of the addres bar showing up at the top.
